# Cooperative Unity Tools

Welcome to the Cooperative Unity Tools repository! This is a community-driven project designed to foster collaboration among Unity developers. Our goal is to create a shared repository of tools and improvements that can help all of us in our game development endeavors.

## Origin

The idea for this repository was sparked by several posts calling for shared resources in the Unity community. Credit goes to Dor Ben Dor and Ido Viron for inspiring this initiative, along with contributions from others in the community. This project aims to provide a common platform where we can all contribute before, during, and after hackathons.

## Contributing

We encourage everyone to participate! Here’s how you can get involved:

- **Fork and Clone**: Start by forking the repo and cloning it to your local machine.
- **Develop and Test**: Add new tools or improve existing ones. Ensure your contributions are well-tested.
- **Review and Pull Requests**: Feel free to make pull requests. Don’t forget to review others’ contributions to help maintain quality.
- **Discuss**: Got ideas or feedback? Open an issue to discuss new features or tools.

### Getting Started

To get started, you might want to check the existing structure:
- Browse the folders to see what’s already there.
- Pick a tool you are interested in improving or documentation you could enhance.
- Or start a new tool from scratch!

### Guidelines

Currently, there are no strict rules or limitations. However, we appreciate adherence to a few guidelines to keep the repository organized:
- **Keep it Modular**: Make sure tools are modular and well-documented.
- **Be Respectful**: Provide constructive feedback and respect other contributors.
- **Stay Engaged**: Regular contributions and updates will keep our project lively and useful.

## Future Plans

- Hackathon for tools development is planned for the future.
- As the community grows and more contributions are made, we will establish more defined guidelines and possibly structure the repository into more detailed categories. Your feedback and contributions will help shape the future of this project!

Thank you for being a part of this innovative community initiative. Let’s build something great together!
